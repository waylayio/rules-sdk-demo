# rules-sdk-demo
A small demo app using only `react` and the `waylay rules-sdk`
This app uses the builder part of the `rules-sdk`, all code can be found in `App.js`

Since the sdk hasn't been released yet, I've packed `.tgz` version of the sdk in this app.

To get the upload to waylay working, fill in the `clientID`, `clientSecret` and `domain` in the `App.js`.
A config setup has been done, this can be viewed/edited in `sdk-config.json`.
